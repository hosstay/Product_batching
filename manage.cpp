 *  Description: C++ program that includes a class named Product to be used for an inventory management system
 *               The program has a item ID, name, category, and stock all of which can be accessed, but only
 *               the name and category can be changed directly, and the stock changed indirectly via the
 *               ship and receive functions. The class has checks to make sure the stock is never less than
 *               0. The management interface uses these commands to showcase some uses of the Product class.
